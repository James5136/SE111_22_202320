        <p style="text-align: center"> <b style="color: blue">Hello!</b> My name is <i style="color: red">James Keyes</i>, and I have made this to talk about myself. 
            First, let's talk about family. I have my mom and dad, including my two incredible dogs, <b>Jack</b> and <b>Gus</b>. 
            Next, I will talk about hobbies. I find it fun to swim, whether that be in a pool or the ocean. 
            Also, I enjoy playing a game of <u><b>chess</b></u> every once in and while. Furthermore, I appreciate the precious commodity that is <i>sleep</i>. 
            Finally, my career goal is to become a <u>Network Engineer</u>. Have a Great Day! </p>
