                <p><em>WALL-E</em> is a movie that can only be described as a timeless classic. The visuals of the film, while old, are still phenomenal to look at and help inspire a sense of awe with its scenes. However, the most impressive part of this film is its introduction to the setting. The movie starts with upbeat music about adventure, only for the camera to turn and show a lifeless earth with no greenery and how it now has an orbit full of satellites and debris. This introduction is one of the best, as the music helps give an ominous feeling due to the complete contrast of how the earth looks. </p>

                <p>Equally as important are the characters. WALL-E and EVE are brilliantly done characters, even if they barely say a word in the movie. You come to understand and empathize with them. WALL-E, for instance, is shown to be lonely and desires love and affection. When all put together, <em>WALL-E</em> is a fantastic film that can be enjoyed by all.</p>
